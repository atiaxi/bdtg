# Characters

In gameplay terms, characters in Blood Down the Gullet are defined by a set of attributes, a pool of specific skills, three defense values, and combat abilities.

## Attributes

The six core character attributes are identical to the traditional D&D attribute set: **STR**, **DEX**, **CON**, **INT**, **WIS**, and **CHA**. Your character sheet will list a modifier, either positive or negative, for each of these attributes.

When you attempt to accomplish a non-trivial task that isn't covered by any of your skills, the DM will choose a difficulty and an attribute. Roll 1d20 and add that attribute's modifier. If your result is *greater than or equal to* the chosen difficulty, you succeed. If it's less, you fail. If it's greater by a lot, you do really well; it it's less by a lot, you fail hard.

## Skills

Each of these six attributes is further specialized into a number of *skills*. Skills represent more specific applications of a core attribute to some kind of task that you're either especially proficient in or unusually bad at. Each skill will add a bonus or a penalty to your base attribute modifier.

In general, the more specific a particular skill is, or the more of a drawback it has, the higher the skill's bonus will be. You'll begin with at least one general skill, one specific skill, and one penalty for each attribute.

 * **+2** skills are general and can be applicable to a variety of situations.
 * **+4** skills are specific or have drawbacks or additional costs.
 * **-2** skills are general tasks that you're unusually bad at.

Skills are useful in freeform roleplay, but if you're creative, you can also take advantage of them as combat actions or to aid stunts for a concert.

## Defenses

Each of you (and each enemy) have three distinct defense values:

 * **Reflex** represents your ability to prevent attacks from making physical contact with you.
 * **Fortitude** represents your gut strength; your ability to fight off infections and poisons.
 * **Will** captures your resistance to mental attacks.

Rather than having its own defense value, armor will generally either raise your Reflex defense (meaning, it makes it harder to make contact) or grants you some degree of damage resistance (it absorbs the blow).

## Abilities

You'll have a set of combat abilities for signature attacks that you perform in combat. They're described in more detail in [the combat section](combat.md#skill-charges).

## Character Creation

Because this is a homebrew system, there aren't any charts to consult or lists to choose from. Instead, we'll hash everything out over email, and tune and balance your characters as we see how they play.

To begin, come up with ideas for:

 * Your character's name and race. Races that are available are mostly the standard D&D ones but this isn't the strictest setting, so you can be creative if you like.
 * What instrument you play in the band.
 * Your primary and secondary combat roles: these are general descriptions like damage dealer, healer, buffs or control. Your primary role will govern what you can do at-will while your secondary role will be represented by abilities that are either more expensive or have drawbacks of some kind.
  * Of course, whatever other backstory or flavor you want to add.
