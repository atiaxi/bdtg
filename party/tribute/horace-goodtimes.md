## Backstory

> I'm old enough to have been a fan of the original Blood Down the Gullet, although I probably wasn't as chummy with them as I claim...
> I've done a lot of drugs over the last XX years between then and now.
> I took care of all these orphans because I felt bad about all their parents being slaughtered by the Band.
> These kids can't do anything wrong as far as I'm concerned, so I ignored any bad behavior that they may/may not exhibit.
> These days, well... I hang around like a paternal figure because I don't really have anywhere else to be.
