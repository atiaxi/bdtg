## Backstory
Adopted by a well-meaning, religious couple who tried hard to teach her the ways of Light and Goodness but finally gave up and sent her to boarding school to straighten her out, Anna has always felt a calling back to her Metal roots.  She ran away from her religious high school to be reunited with the group, and insists on being called "Slayer".
