# Combat

Combat in Blood Down the Gullet should feel mostly familiar to veterans of 4E. You'll roll initiative to determine the turn order for this combat. Within each turn, you'll have one move, one minor and one standard action to take, with the ability to trade any down to a lesser action (taking an additional move instead of a standard, for example). You'll have a small library of ability cards as part of your character sheet, most of which will involve rolling a d20, adding some base score, and comparing the result to an enemy's defense value.

The major differences that you'll notice will be in how movement is tracked, and how skills are consumed and recharged.

## Movement

Rather than a battle grid, the area available for movement within combat is represented by a graph. Each node in the graph is a significant landmark, piece of cover, or other location of interest within the battlefield where players and enemies may gather. Moving between two connected nodes costs a single move action.

There's no limit to the number of characters who can be at a particular node at one time. Conceptually, everyone there is milling around in a drunken stupor trying to flank and stab one another all the time.

### Ability Ranges

Any characters at the same node are within **melee** range. Any characters at other nodes are **ranged**. Things like cover and lines of sight and effect are mediated by the GM.

Most abilities will target a single target within the relevant range. **Burst** abilities target *all* eligible targets in a targeted node. Melee burst abilities hit all targets at the same node as you; ranged burst abilities hit all targets in a node you choose (that you can reach).

### Opportunity Attacks

Moving through a node occupied by a hostile character gives that character a chance to smack you one while you pass through. They can use any At-Will ability to do so.

Each character gets only a single opportunity attack per round, unless I forget, in which case they get more than one.

Opportunity attacks are also granted against any hostile character using a ranged ability while in melee range.

### Combat Advantage

Because we're not tracking the finer details of who's flanking who, you can assume you've got combat advantage against any hostile character:

 1. At the same node as you,
 2. While you have at least one ally there,
 3. Who didn't attack you last round.

You also have combat advantage against opponents who don't know you're there, or can't see or hear you.

Combat advantage does *not* grant a +2 bonus to attacks, though. Mostly it's useful for triggering Rogue / Drummer abilities.
